/*! HarmonicDihedralForceComputeGPU implements the same calculations as HarmonicDihedralForceCompute,
    but executing on the GPU.

    Per-type parameters are stored in a simple global memory area pointed to by
    \a m_gpu_params. They are stored as Scalar2's with the \a x component being K and the
    \a y component being t_0.

    The GPU kernel can be found in dihedralforce_kernel.cu.
