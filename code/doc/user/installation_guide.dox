\section sec_install_hoomd_linux Installing HOOMD-blue in Linux

 \subsection sec_install_hoomd_linux_redhat CentOS/RHEL/Fedora

1. Install the latest drivers for your GPU. You can download drivers directly from [NVIDIA](http://www.nvidia.com). You may find it more convenient to use RPMs from [elrepo](http://elrepo.org/tiki/kmod-nvidia) (CentOS/RHEL) or [rpmfusion](http://rpmfusion.org/Howto/nVidia) (Fedora).
2. Download and import the HOOMD-blue GPG public key (you only need to perform this step once).
~~~~~
wget http://codeblue.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/downloads/RPM-GPG-KEY-joaander
sudo rpm --import RPM-GPG-KEY-joaander
~~~~~
3. Download the HOOMD-blue RPM package for you linux distribution from http://codeblue.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/download.html
4. To **install** *or upgrade* double click on the downloaded file, or open a terminal, cd to the directory where you downloaded the file and run
~~~~~
sudo yum localinstall hoomd-*.rpm
~~~~~

\subsection sec_install_hoomd_linux_suse OpenSUSE

1. Install the latest drivers for your GPU. Follow these [OpenSUSE instructions](http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:NVIDIA_drivers) to install the NVIDIA driver package.
2. Download and import the HOOMD-blue GPG public key (you only need to perform this step once).
~~~~~
wget http://codeblue.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/downloads/RPM-GPG-KEY-joaander
sudo rpm --import RPM-GPG-KEY-joaander
~~~~~
3. Download the HOOMD-blue RPM package for you linux distribution from http://codeblue.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/download.html
4. To **install** *or upgrade* double click on the downloaded file, or open a terminal, cd to the directory where you downloaded the file and run
~~~~~
sudo zypper install hoomd*.rpm
~~~~~

\subsection sec_install_hoomd_linux_ubuntu Ubuntu

1. Install the latest drivers for your GPU. See the [Ubuntu documentation](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia) for instructions.
3. Download the HOOMD-blue deb package for you linux distribution from http://codeblue.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/download.html
4. To **install** *or upgrade* double click on the downloaded file, or open a terminal, cd to the directory where you downloaded the file and run
~~~~
sudo dpkg -i hoomd-blue*.deb
~~~~

\subsection sec_install_hoomd_linux_homedir Home directory installation

If you do not have administrator access or otherwise desire to install hoomd into your home directory,
it is recommended that you compile hoomd from source. See \ref page_compile_guide for detailed
information.

<hr>

\section sec_install_hoomd_mac Installing HOOMD-blue in Mac OS X

1. Install the latest drivers for your GPU. NVIDIA provides [installer packages](http://www.nvidia.com/object/mac-driver-archive.html) for download.
2. Download the HOOMD-blue dmg package from http://codeblue.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/download.html
3. Double click on the downloaded dmg file and drag the HOOMD-blue application to the desired location on your hard drive to install it. The following instructions assume you install HOOMD-blue in /Applications
4. Launch HOOMD-blue by double clicking on the application. You may also drag it to your dock and launch it from there. This will launch the HOOMD-blue python interpreter.
5. Perform the following steps to prepare HOOMD-blue for use from the command line. Open< a terminal window and execute
~~~~
open ~/.bash_profile
~~~~
To open your ~/.bash_profile file.  Add this line to the end:
~~~~
alias hoomd="/Applications/HOOMD-blue.app/Contents/MacOS/hoomd"
~~~~
Adjust the name of the directory to match the one you installed. The alias will only take effect in newly opened terminal windows. You **must** remove the alias if you switch to compiling HOOMD-blue from source or by any other installation method.

\b Experimental:
The OS X .dmg application installation method is experimental. It only works if the OS X default python is installed and on the PATH. If you have installed any other python distribution (such as through macports), this application might not run. Macports users: restore the system python to the PATH with "sudo port select python python27-apple. Also, clicking on the HOOMD-blue application icon does nothing.

<hr>

\section sec_install_hoomd_test Test your installation

Run the standard benchmark scripts to test your installation.

\b Linux:
~~~~~
 cd /usr/share/hoomd/benchmarks
 hoomd lj_liquid_bmark.hoomd
 # ... watch the simulation run ...
~~~~~

On CentOS 6, RHEL 6, and Fedora 18 you need to launch hoomd with mpirun even when running on a single core/GPU:
~~~~~
 /usr/lib64/openmpi/bin/mpirun -n 1 hoomd lj_liquid_bmark.hoomd
~~~~~

\b Mac:
~~~~~
cd /Applications/HOOMD-blue.app/Contents/share/hoomd/benchmarks/
hoomd lj_liquid_bmark.hoomd
# ... watch the simulation run ...
~~~~~

See the \ref page_quick_start to start learning how to use hoomd.

\section sec_gpu_options Supported GPUs

A GPU is needed to take full advantage of HOOMD-blue's performance capabilities. See [the benchmarks page](http://codeblue.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/benchmarks.html) for representative performance numbers.

## Workstation solutions

### Upgrade an existing desktop system

If a desktop computer meets the necessary system requirements, a GPU can be added to it. Neither this document nor the HOOMD-blue developers can determine if your system meets those requirements. Consult an IT professional for advice, if needed. The manufacturer's product page should list the requirements for a particular GPU. One word of caution: pre-built systems from many vendors are often engineered with very little extra space or power. Fast GPUs are both large and power-hungry and will either not fit or fail to operate. A self-powered [Quadro Plex 7000](http://www.nvidia.com/object/product-quadroplex-7000-us.html) might be an option for a desktop with such limitations, but it may also be less expensive to simply buy a new desktop equipped with GeForce GPUs.

For GPU-ready desktops, HOOMD-blue supports many GPUs. NVIDIA GeForce cards are consumer level GPUs designed for gaming.

HOOMD supports the following GPUS:
- [GTX Titan](http://www.geforce.com/hardware/desktop-gpus/geforce-gtx-titan) - **Recommended** for performance desktops
- [GTX 780 Ti](http://www.geforce.com/hardware/desktop-gpus/geforce-gtx-780-ti)
- [GTX 680](http://www.geforce.com/hardware/desktop-gpus/geforce-gtx-680)
- [GTX 580](http://www.geforce.com/hardware/desktop-gpus/geforce-gtx-580) - *previous generation*
- And all GeForce GPUs with compute capability greater than or equal to 2.0 [see the full list at NVIDIA's web page](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus)

Tesla GPUs are professional level compute cards with more memory than their consumer-level counterparts.
Also, Tesla cards are capable of significantly more double precision FLOPS than their GeForce equivalents.
- [Tesla K40](http://www.nvidia.com/object/tesla-servers.html) - **Recommended** for performance desktops
- [Tesla K20](http://www.nvidia.com/object/tesla-servers.html)
- [Tesla K10](http://www.nvidia.com/object/tesla-servers.html)
- [Tesla C2075](http://www.nvidia.com/object/tesla-servers.html) - *previous generation*
- [Tesla C2050](http://www.nvidia.com/object/tesla-servers.html)
- And all Tesla Workstation GPUs with compute capability greater than or equal to 2.0 [see the full list at NVIDIA's web page](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus)

Quadro GPUs are professional level graphics workstation cards.
- [Quadro K6000](http://www.nvidia.com/object/quadro-desktop-gpus.html)
- [Quadro K5000](http://www.nvidia.com/object/quadro-k5000.html)
- And all Quadro GPUs with compute capability greater than or equal to 2.0 [see the full list at NVIDIA's web page](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus)

### Purchase a new workstation
Pre-built workstations can be purchased from a number of vendors with any of the above GeForce, Tesla, or Quadro GPUs. Check out vendors that offer custom gaming rigs. Some offer high performance configurations with up to 3 GPUs. NVIDIA maintains a list of vendors that sells workstations with Tesla GPUs pre-installed: see http://www.nvidia.com/object/tesla_wtb.html

### Data center installations

Data centers demand rack mount hardware and resiliency to thermal environments. There are several GPU computing systems supported by HOOMD. All of the Tesla cards listed above also come in *m* variants designed for use in server hardware. There are many vendors that sell systems with 1-8 GPUs per node. See the list of vendors that NVIDIA maintains: http://www.nvidia.com/object/where-to-buy-tesla.html.

<h2>Laptops</h2>

There are many mobile GPUs capable of running HOOMD-blue. Due to power, heat, and stability concerns, the HOOMD-blue developers
do not support laptops as a platform for long running hoomd simulations.

<h2>Future GPUs</h2>
GPUs newer than this document may also be supported. HOOMD-blue 1.0 is tested and supported on the Kepler (GK110)
and Fermi (GF100) generations. All GPUs from these generations are supported.
