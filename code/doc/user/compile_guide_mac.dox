\section sec_build_mac_prereq Software Prerequisites

HOOMD-blue requires a number of prerequisite software packages and libraries to be installed before it can be compiled.
Macports (http://www.macports.org) greatly simplifies the installation of these.

This page assumes that you have a standard terminal window open. Commands to run in the terminal will be indicated as
below:
~~~~.bash
$ echo hello
hello
~~~~
`$` indicates a shell prompt. As demonstrated above, if you type `echo hello`, then you should see the same output
obtained above on the next line: `hello`

1. **Install macports:**
Go to [the macports homepage](http://www.macports.org) and download the appropriate dmg for your system. Mount the dmg
by double-clicking on it. Double-click on the pkg installer for macports and follow the on-screen instructions to
complete the install. If you have not yet installed the Apple developer tools (Xcode) on your system, you will need to
do so now. Follow the instructions in [the macports documentation](http://guide.macports.org/). Then run the macports
selfupdate command to bring your install fully up to date:
~~~~.bash
$ sudo port selfupdate
...
~~~~

2. **Install cmake, boost, and python:**
Run the following command in a terminal to install all prerequisite software to build hoomd.
~~~~.bash
$ sudo port install cmake boost +python27 python_select openmpi-default
~~~~
After macports finishes the above command, run
~~~~.bash
$ sudo port select python python27
$ sudo port select mpi openmpi-mp-fortran
~~~~
to select the python that macports installed. This step is crucial, or else you will get python <i>version mismatch</i>
or <i>'NoneType'</i> errors when trying to run hoomd.
You can switch back to the Apple installed python at any time by running
~~~~
$ sudo port select python python26-apple
~~~~
or see a list of all python installations you can switch between with
~~~~
$ port select python
~~~~

3. **Install the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit and driver:**
If you have an NVIDIA GPU, Download the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit (version 5.5 or newer) appropriate for your system from
[NVIDIA's CUDA download page](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads). To install, open Finder, navigate to the
directory where you downloaded the file and double-click on it. Follow the on screen prompts to complete the
installation. Download the [NVIDIA CUDA Drivers](http://www.nvidia.com/object/mac-driver-archive.html).
To install, open Finder, navigate to the directory where you downloaded the file and double-click on it.
Follow the on screen prompts to complete the installation.

4. **Install doxygen:**
[Download the doxygen dmg](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/). Mount the dmg by double-clicking on it. Install
by dragging Doxygen to your /Applications directory. Class diagrams are generated automatically when you have graphviz
installed. You can install it with macports.
~~~~.bash
$ sudo port install graphviz
~~~~

5. **Install git:**
[Download the git dmg](http://git-scm.com/) and install the software.
